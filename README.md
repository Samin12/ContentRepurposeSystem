# Content Repurpose System

**One YouTube video in → a blog post, a Twitter thread, two LinkedIn posts, a Skool guide, and 3–5 short-form clips out — all in your voice, all grounded in your channel's real performance data.**

This is a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin. It bundles seven skills into a single, ordered workflow: you **onboard once**, then run the system before and after every video you publish. Instead of a generic "write me a tweet" prompt, every asset is generated through *your* Voice DNA and benchmarked against *your* top-performing titles.

> The running example in this README uses the channel **[@SaminYasar_](https://www.youtube.com/@SaminYasar_)** — Claude Code tutorials for stock-trading automation. Swap in your own handle during onboarding and everything below works the same.

## The mental model

```
                         ┌─────────────┐
                         │  /onboard   │   ← run once: channel + Voice DNA + keys
                         └──────┬──────┘
                                │
        BEFORE you film ────────┼──────── AFTER you publish
                                │
   /ideation  →  /yt-titles     │     /content-cascade  →  blog + Twitter + LinkedIn (+guide)
       ↓             ↓          │            ↓
   /hooks     →  /outlines      │     /short-form       →  3–5 Reels / Shorts / TikTok clips
       │                        │
       └──── film the video ────┘
```

You publish **one** video. The system turns it into **a week of content** across six channels.

## Install

### Option A — as a plugin (recommended)

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add Samin12/ContentRepurposeSystem
/plugin install content-repurpose-system
```

Restart Claude Code so the skills load, then run `/onboard`.

### Option B — clone and install the skills directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samin12/ContentRepurposeSystem.git
cd ContentRepurposeSystem
cp -R skills/* ~/.claude/skills/      # note: no trailing slash on skills/*
```

Restart Claude Code, then run `/onboard`.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Install |
|------|-----|---------|
| **yt-dlp** | reads your upload history + "latest video" | `pip install yt-dlp` |
| **Node.js** | transcript fetching + thread posting | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Python 3** | channel performance script | usually preinstalled |
| `youtube-transcript` *(optional)* | free transcript fallback | `npm install youtube-transcript` |

The `/onboard` skill checks all of these for you and prints the exact install command for anything missing.

---

## Step-by-step walkthrough

Here's exactly what a session looks like, from zero to a full content drop, using @SaminYasar_ as the example.

### Step 1 — `/onboard` (once)

```
You:  /onboard
```

Claude walks you through three things:

**1. Connect your channel.**
```
Claude: What's your YouTube channel handle or URL?
You:    @SaminYasar_
Claude: Connected to @SaminYasar_. I can now read your upload history
        and pull your latest video automatically.
```
This writes your channel into the performance script and resolves your canonical channel ID, so later skills can find your real videos.

**2. Capture your Voice DNA.** Claude asks ~3 questions and folds the answers into every content prompt:
```
Claude: In one or two sentences, how would you describe your voice?
You:    Warm and confident, analogy-first (poker, thermostats, car
        insurance), I always back claims with real numbers, and I close
        with a soft "come build with us in the Claude Club."
Claude: Who's your audience and what do you teach them?
You:    Non-coders learning to build and automate with Claude — right now,
        stock-trading automation.
```
From now on, your blog/Twitter/LinkedIn output sounds like *you*, not like a template.

**3. Optional keys.** Apify (reliable transcripts), Supabase (auto-save drafts), Twitter (auto-post). All skippable — say "skip" and add them later.

**At the end, onboarding prints your workflow map** and a suggested first command. You only do this once per channel.

---

### Step 2 — `/ideation` — what should I make?

```
You:  /ideation Claude Code for stock trading
```

You get **7–10 positioned ideas**, each mapped to a core desire, scored for "shock," and checked against competitive gaps. The Tier 1 picks look like:

```
## I Let Claude Code Copy Every Trade a Senator Makes

- Angle:           Turn public Capitol Trades disclosures into an automated
                   paper-trading bot — nobody has shown the full build.
- Core Desire:     Money  →  Proxy: "trade like someone with inside access,
                   legally, on autopilot"
- Shock Score:     86/100
- Format:          Case Study (build + result reveal)
- Competitive Gap: Plenty of "politicians beat the market" explainers,
                   zero end-to-end "here's the bot" tutorials.
- Why Now:         Capitol Trades API is free + congressional trading is
                   trending after the latest disclosure cycle.
```

Pick one and carry it into the next steps.

---

### Step 3 — `/yt-titles` — title it like your hits

```
You:  /yt-titles a video where I build a bot that copies senator stock trades
```

This is the skill that makes the system *yours*: **Step 1 pulls your actual top performers** (via `channel_performance.py`), finds the title patterns your audience already rewards, then generates titles in that pattern. Output:

```
## Your Top Performers (last 3 months)
Your "I Let Claude…" + concrete-outcome format outperforms your how-to titles
~3x on views/day. Numbers and a clear result are doing the work.

## Title Options

### Tier 1 — High Confidence
1. I Built a Bot That Copies Senator Stock Trades (Claude Code)
   Based on your "I Built…" pattern — proven, names the tool, concrete.
2. Claude Code vs. Congress: I Copied Their Trades for 30 Days
   Your contrarian + timeframe pattern; "vs." adds tension.

### Tier 3 — Swing for the Fences
8. I Gave Claude My Brokerage Account. Here's What Happened.
   Pattern-break curiosity gap — higher risk, higher ceiling.

## Thumbnail Text Options
For "I Built a Bot That Copies Senator Stock Trades":
1. "LEGAL?"      — tension against the title's premise
2. "+18% / MO"   — concrete proof the title withholds
```

---

### Step 4 — `/hooks` — nail the first 15 seconds

```
You:  /hooks I Built a Bot That Copies Senator Stock Trades with Claude Code
```

Uses the Kallaway desire-based framework to produce **three fully-aligned hooks** (visual + spoken + on-screen text), each scored against the Four Commandments:

```
### Hook 1 — Case Study + "About Me"
Spoken:       "I gave Claude Code a list of every stock a senator bought
              last quarter — and let it trade them for me."
Visual:       Screen recording: Capitol Trades feed → Claude Code running →
              Alpaca paper account ticking up
Text overlay: "COPYING CONGRESS"
Power Words:  Subject ✓ Action ✓ Objective ✓ Contrast ✓ Time ✓ (5/6)
Commandments: Alignment ✓ Speed ✓ Clarity ✓ Curiosity ✓ (4/4)
```

---

### Step 5 — `/outlines` — a recording-ready script

```
You:  /outlines the senator-copy-trading bot video, ~14 minutes
```

You get a full outline in recording format: hook, structured body sections with talking points, **visual-aid callouts**, demo beats, source citations, per-section time budgets, and a production-notes block (competitive landscape, title ideas, thumbnail moments, honest limitations). You sit down and film straight from it.

```
## Hook (~60s)            [the aligned hook from Step 4]
## Section 1 — The Setup (~2.5 min)
   Core idea:  Congressional trades are public — and weirdly good.
   Talking points: • Capitol Trades is free  • the disclosure lag
   Visual aid: → screen recording of the Capitol Trades feed
   Source:     capitoltrades.com
## Section 2 — Wiring Claude Code to Alpaca (~5 min)  [demo-heavy]
...
## Production Notes  →  3 competitor titles, 3 thumbnail moments, limitations
```

**→ Now you film and upload the video.** YouTube takes 30–60 min to generate captions; once they're live, continue.

---

### Step 6 — `/content-cascade` — the long-tail content

```
You:  /content-cascade latest
```

Claude auto-detects your latest upload, fetches the transcript, classifies the video (tutorial vs. discussion), and generates — **in your voice**:

- **A 1,500–2,500 word blog post** with SEO metadata (title, description, slug, keywords, tags, cover image)
- **A Twitter/X thread** built around the single best angle
- **A LinkedIn post** mirroring the video's premise
- Because this one is a *tutorial*, it also generates a **LinkedIn lead-magnet post** + a **Skool-ready HTML guide**

Each piece is shown to you for review before saving. With keys configured it can auto-save drafts to Supabase and auto-post the thread; without them, everything saves as local markdown under `content/`.

---

### Step 7 — `/short-form` — slice the clips

```
You:  /short-form latest
```

Scans the transcript for the **3–5 most clip-worthy moments** (self-contained insight, shock value, emotional peak, demo reveal) and for each one gives you timestamps, a scroll-stopping hook, a ready-to-paste caption, and hashtags — ranked by *best for reach / conversions / engagement*.

```
### Clip 1: "Is this legal?" — Best for reach
Timestamps:   02:14 → 03:01   (~47s)
Hook:         Text "IS THIS LEGAL?"  |  Spoken "Yes, copying a senator's
              stock trades is completely legal — here's the catch."
Caption:      Congress has to disclose their trades. So I had Claude trade
              them for me 👀  Full build on the channel.
Hashtags:     #claudecode #ai #stocktrading #investing #fintech
```

## What you have at the end

After one filmed video and two commands, your `content/` folder (or Supabase drafts) holds:

| Asset | From | Ready for |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 📝 Blog post (SEO-optimized) | `content-cascade` | your website / newsletter |
| 🐦 Twitter/X thread | `content-cascade` | X (optionally auto-posted) |
| 💼 LinkedIn post | `content-cascade` | LinkedIn |
| 🧲 LinkedIn lead-magnet post | `content-cascade` *(tutorials)* | LinkedIn → email capture |
| 📚 Skool guide (HTML) | `content-cascade` *(tutorials)* | your Skool / Claude Club |
| 🎬 3–5 short-form clips | `short-form` | Reels, Shorts, TikTok |

Plus, from the pre-production side: a ranked idea, a tested title + thumbnail text, an aligned hook, and a filmable outline — so the next video is faster than the last.

## The skills

| Order | Skill | Command | What it does |
|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | **onboard** | `/onboard` | One-time setup: channel, Voice DNA, optional keys |
| 1 | **ideation** | `/ideation <topic>` | Positioned video ideas with gaps, desire mapping, shock scores |
| 2 | **yt-titles** | `/yt-titles <idea>` | Titles ranked against *your* top performers + thumbnail text |
| 3 | **hooks** | `/hooks <title>` | Kallaway-framework hooks (visual + spoken + text), scored |
| 4 | **outlines** | `/outlines <idea>` | Recording-ready outline with time budgets + production notes |
| 5 | **content-cascade** | `/content-cascade <url\|latest>` | Blog + Twitter + LinkedIn (+ lead magnet + guide) |
| 6 | **short-form** | `/short-form <url\|latest>` | 3–5 clips with hooks, captions, hashtags, timestamps |

Each skill also activates from natural language — you don't have to use the slash command. "Give me title ideas for…" triggers `yt-titles`; "make shorts from my latest video" triggers `short-form`.

---

## Configuration & optional integrations

Everything optional lives in `skills/content-cascade/.env` (copy from [`.env.example`](.env.example)). `/onboard` can write it for you.

- **Apify** — most reliable transcript fetching, especially for videos uploaded in the last hour. Free tier.
- **Supabase** — auto-save blog posts and social drafts to a database instead of local files.
- **Twitter/X** — auto-post the generated thread.

Without any of these, the system still does the full pipeline — it just saves to local markdown and you copy-paste to publish.

> **Note on competitor scanning:** the `ideation`, `outlines`, and `yt-titles` skills can optionally run a YouTube competitor scan via a separate `yt-search` helper that does **not** ship with this plugin. Those steps are clearly marked optional and degrade gracefully — every skill produces its full output without them. Your *own* channel performance data (used by `yt-titles`) is built in and works out of the box.

---

## FAQ

**Do I have to run the skills in order?**
No — each works standalone. The order is the *recommended* end-to-end flow. Already filmed? Jump straight to `/content-cascade`.

**Does this post to my accounts?**
Only if you set up the Twitter keys and explicitly say to post. By default everything saves as a draft for your review.

**"Captions aren't available yet."**
YouTube takes 30–60 minutes to generate captions after upload. Run the cascade again a bit later, or add an Apify token for more reliable fetching of fresh uploads.

**How do I switch channels or refresh my voice?**
Re-run `/onboard` — it updates the same config in place.
